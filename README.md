# ArtWork
Bringing mural-needing businesses and money-needing artists together

MOTIVATION
Office spaces have changed a lot over the past few years. The days of boring white walls and cubicles are very much long gone for creative companies. Instead- more intimate and homey office environments have taken over. Many of which, have inspiring and visually appealing works of art (graffiti most commonly) all over their office walls. It's a growing and already strong trend for startups and businesses of all sizes in America. So how can an individual artist break into this growing market, without going through the difficult starting up their own mural business? 
Here's where ArtWork comes in...
ArtWork is a platform for businesses to find the perfect artist to paint the officespace mural of their corporate dreams. Artists sign up to be featured on the site for businesses to peruse through, and in return find themselves more clients for mural work.
